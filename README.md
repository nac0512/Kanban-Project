## Things to know

* Music can be enabled/disabled by using the music note icoon in the header. 

* In addition to recieving tasks via API, you will also be able to add, edit, and delete tasks and have it stored in the API, as well. It is important to note that if the API is not interacted with constantly, it will go to sleep and your changes will not be visible unless you refresh. If loading message does not go away, be sure to refresh. 

* The page is responsive dependingon screen size.
